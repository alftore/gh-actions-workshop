# CI/CD workshop using Github actions

## Workshop

In the [Tasks](./tasks.md) file you will find the tasks for the workshop. Do as many as you can, but don't worry if you can't finish them all.
For this workshop we try to cater all experience levels so some of the tasks might be too easy or too hard for you.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are stuck, ask for help. We are here to help you.
> Using AI to solve the tasks is encouraged.
To display the build status from GitHub Actions, you can use a Shields.io badge. Here's an example markdown:
